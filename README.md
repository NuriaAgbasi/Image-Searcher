# Unsplash Image Search App

This project is a simple web application that allows users to search for images using the Unsplash API. Users can enter a search term, and the app will display a list of images related to that term. If no images are found, the app will inform the user to try a different search term. Users can also load more results by clicking a "Show More" button.
